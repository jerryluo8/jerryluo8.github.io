This is the real exam that I took and passed! My points were as follows: 

1: 10
2: 10
3: 2
4: x
5: 10
6: 10
7: 10
8: 10
9: 10
10: x
11: 10
12: 7
sum: 89

x = ungraded

It's interesting because I had no idea I was so close to the cutoff score! 

The passing score was 88/100... I have no idea why it's even allowed to be this high!

The error in 12 was in the backward direction. 

I don't really know what the error in 3 was.
