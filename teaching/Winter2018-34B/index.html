			Welcome to Math 34B! 
		<p>
			I will be using this page to post the worksheets and <i>potentially</i> <u>selected</u> solutions to the problems on the worksheet. In general, you can find most of the important files (that have to do with me of course) on here. 
		<p>
			As a TA, my goal is to help you succeed in this course. As such, I want to know what I can do to best help you succeed. If you have any feedback for how I'm doing, what you want to see, or anything else, please fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/juyM5NqwQHjLZ0yl1" target="_blank">this (anonymous) form</a>.

			<u><b>A NOTE ON ATTENDANCE:</b></u> As most of you know, both lecture and section attendance are optional (ie. they are not a part of your grade). The intent for this is that as grownups, we trust you to make decisions for yourselves in regards to what's best for you and to take responsibility for your actions. For example, if you have health issues (eg. a cold) or personal/family matters (eg. a wedding), we don't want to penalize you for not being able to make it to section. In fact, if this is you, I encourage you to let me know after the fact, and if need be, we can set up an appointment to catch you back up to speed.
		<p>
			<b>HOWEVER</b>, this does not mean you should make a habit of skipping section. In fact, I want to point out that in previous quarters (last one in particular), the students that attended section often did better than students who didn't. In particular, those with poor exam scores were predominantly those who did not come to section. So while your grade isn't directly impacted by lack of attendance, the effect will almost uniformly show up on the exams. In other words, although	you're certainly free to not come to section "without penalty", it's probably a good idea to do so.
		<p>
