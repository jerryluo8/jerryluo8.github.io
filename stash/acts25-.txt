Acts 25-
This is a not-so long list of questions, some of which are more relevant to the text while others are only relevant by a thread. 
The thing about scripture is that it's not just some text we read and then continue living life as if nothing happened. 
Even as culture may change and our understanding of the original context may fade, it has relevance to *this* day and age where we are, just as it did 2,000 years ago in the middle of the Roman Empire.
I'm hoping these questions ground us back to the tangibility of Jesus and his work in our lives. 
With that said, I don't expect anyone to finish answering this list of questions. 
Please pick and choose as you wish. Or, if you and your group want to talk about / discuss / focus on other stuff entirely, please feel free to do that!
If you have any questions about any of this, please feel free to snag me from whichever group I'm in.
If/when you're done (either by actually finishing the questions or by deciding that enough is enough xP), feel free to spend time praying for one another and/or talking about how things are going in life. Or, just do that to begin with if you so choose!

Lastly, something to note: if you have trouble answering any of the questions, feel free to pass. In particular, please do not force out answers that you have trouble standing behind. 

Acts 25
1) Have there been instances when people have made false statement/judgements/assumptions about you? How have your responded?
2) In light of 1), how often do you put your worth/identity in what others say/think about you? That is, how often do you feel the need to prove yourself to others?
3) From what do you derive your identity? 

Acts 26
Our testimonies are powerful, because by definition, they are something unique to us that we get to own. 
1) How has your testimony been received by others?
1.5) What are ways in which you've seen pushback against your testimony, both in and out of the church?
2) Throughout your walk with him, who has God been to you? Be specific and concrete. 
3) Time-permitting, feel free to share (parts of) your testimony. 

Acts 27
When things go wrong, or quite simply, when things don't go the way we expected/wanted, we sometimes freak out. 
1) How are you in trusting God through the unexpected/disappointment? 
2) What are ways in which you've learned to trust in God throughout your walk with him?
3) What are ways you've seen God show up in your life? Feel free to share examples. 

Acts 28
There are instances in our lives when we're expected to be heading a certain direction, only to be rerouted on a detour. 
1) What are some detours you've experienced in your life? What opportunities, if any, did God give you while you were rerouted? 

Acts 29+
While Acts 28 is the final chapter of the Acts of the Apostles as records by Luke, it only marks the beginning of the spread of the Gospel to the ends of the earth.
1) What are ***tangible*** ways in which the Gospel has affected/changed your life? Please share concrete examples. 
2) What are ways in which you've seen the Gospel of Jesus furthered through your life? 
3. What does it mean ***for you*** to live a life worthy of the Gospel?
